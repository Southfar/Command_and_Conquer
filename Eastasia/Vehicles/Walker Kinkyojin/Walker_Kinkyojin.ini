; Titan Mk. II (Missile Chem Red with explosion TWLT100)
; Titan Chaingun

; The "Steel Colossus", or "Medium Mecha". 
; As of 23/12/38, this is no longer the Oni. "Oni" designation has been moved to the Stealth Mecha. 
; We've been struggling with the weapon assignments for this unit. 
; The new system is as follows: 
; There are two main-weapon classes (Cannon Walker and Missile Walker). 
; Both of them have a secondary chaingun. 
; Upgrading mechs gives them more weapon slots, so that the Cannon and Missile variant can eventually be rolled into the same unit. 
; Also, there are the "artillery" classes, though I'm not sure yet how those fit into this (and with each other). 
;
; Weapon loadout is as follows: this unit has a cannon, and a supporting chaingun. 
; It is supposed to use the cannon at a distance, and against hard targets. 
; It is supposed to use the chaingun against soft targets. 
; Neither weapon can target air. 
;
; This is yet another unit with _a_lot_ of variants. 
; The notation is as follows: 
; First we start with the type of hardware: "Walker", 
; then the designation: "Kinkyojin" (shortened to "Kyojin" to save space). 
; Then we put in "D" for "deployed", if applicable. 
; Then we put in "T" as a header for the tech upgrade "string", if applicable. 
; The tech upgrade "string", following "T", consists of a string of the first alphabetic characters 
; not yet used in that string, alphabetically sorted, corresponding in number to the number of 
; non-additive tech upgrades the unit has - here, possible upgrades are Drone, AI Pilot, Nanite. 
; Each letter may be appended by a number indicating the number of additive tech upgrades (within a dimension indicated by the letter) 
; that the unit has received (this is not really applicable here, so we leave out those numbers). 
; Next are the veterancy levels. The number indicating veterancy level is introduced by the header "E". 
; The number indicates the veterancy level of the unit that corresponds to the statblock. 
; Kinkyojin can be Rookie, Veteran, Elite, Master. 
; It cannot be Legendary, Epic, Mythic.

; Same deal here: deploy auxilliary drone against any target (if you have it),

; then use cannon against ground hard targets, and missiles against air hard targets. 
; Deployed Walker gets range and damage bonus on the cannon.

; wolfpack's WolfMech (Wolf)
; GDI has upgraded their Titan to bridge the gap between their basic mech and the highly advanced Mammoth Mark II. 
; The Wolf is much like the Titan except the basic cannon has been upgraded to fire much more quickly. 
; To keep the mech from tipping over because of the bulkier weapon, the chassis had to be reinforced. 
; As a result, the Wolf is considerably more expensive than the Titan.

; wolfpack's UltimM (Ultima Mech)
; An extremely dangerous unit. The Ultima Mech is another variation of the Titan, replacing the normal cannon with a rapidly-firing artillery weapon. It can fire six shells high into the air in rapid succession, leveling most units in seconds. Its armor has also been increased. However, the weapon and thicker armor plating makes this mech slower than its weaker cousin.
