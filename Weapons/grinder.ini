; The "grinderpoonductor"/"harpinductor". This is a complicated weapon. We want it to deal grind (self-healing, bounty) damage in close combat. 
; That is the easy part. 
; Next, we want the unit to fire harpoons which draw the target in (driving locomotor). 
; Finally, when the target is "destroyed", we want it to be abducted.
