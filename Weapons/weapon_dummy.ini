;Warhead=HollowPointNoBuilding	; ummm yeah... makeshift solution, we just needed somethat thats valid for anything crushable. I wonder how the unit will treat omnicrushresistants.
Warhead=Crush	; Not the above, since disallowing it to target anything will force the use of the weapon that was meant for deploy-only instead. There are a couple of other methods (see Fuxi's dummy weapon above, but this would prevent our nifty crushing attack), but let's see if this one works. If it does, no need to delve into the other options.
