Weapon used on Sherman 105 and Sherman Dozer. Usual percentual stat changes apply when transferring stats from the 105mm to 105HE. Uses HowitzerWH.
Also used on basic Abrams Tank, but this is still subject to some controversy.

;; Tiger Tank's combined anti-armor & anti-building gun - bad against infantry
; The Parder Tank's combined anti-armor & anti-building weapon is now [CannonMM140t2], since it uses RHINAPE. 
; Formerly [TigerCannon90mm], [Cannon140mm]. 
; Subsumes [140mm] (rules de MooMan). 
; The weapon's Damage = 75. This puts it above the damage of TibSun's 120mm (70), 
; but below the damage of RA2's 120mm (90). 
; It is also below the damage (80) of a 120mm that has been extrapolated from the damage of 120mmx, 
; by keeping the damage total and calibre constant. 
; It's unclear what this weapon's calibre could be if it should be consistent with the damage dealt by 
; weapons of lesser caliber. It might be best to classify it as a lesser type of 120mm, or greater type of 105mm. 
; Indeed, it has more overlap with mm105, so let's reclassify it with that.
