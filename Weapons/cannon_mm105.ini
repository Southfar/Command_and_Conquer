;; Tiger Tank's combined anti-armor & anti-building gun - bad against infantry
; The Parder Tank's combined anti-armor & anti-building weapon is now [CannonMM140t2], since it uses RHINAPE. 
; Formerly [TigerCannon90mm], [Cannon140mm]. 
; Subsumes [140mm] (rules de MooMan). 
; The weapon's Damage = 75. This puts it above the damage of TibSun's 120mm (70), 
; but below the damage of RA2's 120mm (90). 
; It is also below the damage (80) of a 120mm that has been extrapolated from the damage of 120mmx, 
; by keeping the damage total and calibre constant. 
; It's unclear what this weapon's calibre could be if it should be consistent with the damage dealt by 
; weapons of lesser caliber. It might be best to classify it as a lesser type of 120mm, or greater type of 105mm. 
; Indeed, it has more overlap with mm105, so let's reclassify it with that.
