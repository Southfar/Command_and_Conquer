;******************************************************************************
; The Bofors Gun is an old, but proven, 40mm autocannon design. Equally effective in short- to medium-altitude anti-aircraft warfare and 
; in repelling lightly armored ground attackers, these guns are put into crew-operated ring mounts, allowing 360Â° air and ground fire. 
; The autocannon quickly tears aircraft and light ground vehicles to shreds and has the rate of fire to overcome the lack of accuracy inherent 
; in anti-aircraft use through sheer volume of fire. Needless to say it is also highly effective in an anti-infantry role, 
; but that may not always be the most economic use to put it to when facing a range of different threats.

76HE
Used on upgunned Sherman / Sherman Firefly. Since usual formula of generating Damage stats etc for new mm-measured weapons (Formula was: (Dmg of original weapon/mm of original weapon)*mm of new weapon) isn't really perfect for generating the stats of new weapons, the 76HE may simply use the stats an elite 75HE would have - there seems to be a certain scheme of increasing a weapon's firepower to Elite status, which I must find out.
