; Sorting out the damage values has been very tedious. 
; Original notes list: 120mm (TD), 120mm (APR) (TD), 120mm (TS), 120mm (RA), 120mm (RA2), 120mmE (RA2)
; 120mm (RA) is really a 120mmx. 
; We re-named 120mm (TS) as 110mm. 
; We're not too sure anymore whether TD contains any 120mm, other than that of the Mammoth Tank (which is 120mmx, though this works via unit settings in TD). 
; Although it would make sense for 90's Abrams Tank to have a 120mm cannon, sources consistently call it "105mm" (although it is also weaker than the 105mm of RA2...)
; "x" weapons generally deal the same *total* damage as their single-burst counterparts (i.e. half the damage per shot)... 
; Balance was more important than realism. 
; Also uncertain is the meaning of "APR". 



Damage=300

; There are essentially three ways to approach this issue. 
; One would be to make Damage = 50 the constant, 
; The other would be to consider the caliber indicated by the ID the constant, and adapt the damage accordingly. 
; The other would be to consider both the caliber indicated by the ID, and the total damage, to be constant, and adapt the Burst = accordingly.
