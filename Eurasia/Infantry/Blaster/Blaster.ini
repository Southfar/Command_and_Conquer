;*** Mad Bomber ***************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This is related to the Grenadier, Machinist, Saboteur, Spy and, of course, Bomber in general. 
; The Machinist deals some damage to a building, sacrificing himself, if it is not damaged enough (otherwise, he captures it). 
; Saboteur and Spy have disabling, but not destructive, effects on buildings (except for Fake structures). 
; The "Bomber" is the synthesis of the D2K Saboteur, TW Fanactic, RA2 Terrorist, Gen/ZH Terrorist, TDR Martyr. 
; The lowest level of that unit simply runs at the target and blows himself up, dealing some damage. 
; The next stage runs to the target and blows it up, sacrificing himself. 
; The next stage runs to the target, attaching C4 which will destroy any building. 
; The vanilla Crazy Ivan (here: Mad Bomber) can attach bombs to any type of target, but isn't as devastating as C4. 
; This unit is a Disabler! It is differentiated from the Bomber! 
; Crazy Ivan is the hero of, and derived from, this. 

; There are two advancement lines to this class: a) sacrifice and survival, b) targeting filter
; Soviets: 
; Bomb-throwing anarchists! Crazy Ivans as regular units have become Mad Bombers. Crazy Ivan is now a Mad Bomber Hero. 
; They can target any kind of target, attach bombs, and are not sacrificed in the process. 
; Nod: 
; 
; Latin Confederation: 
; Regular Confederation gets access to the Fire Bomber. 
; He is disguised, and targets buildings with pyro bombs. 
; Pyro bombs deal some damage and set the building on fire. 
; He has no means of attacking infantry or vehicles. 
; Cuba gets access to the Bomber Lv. 4. 
; He is diguised, and targets buildings with C4. 
; This will instantly destroy the building. 
; He has no means of attacking infantry or vehicles. 
;
; NOD/RAFA
; They have access to the Bomber Lv. 3C ("Saboteur")
; He is cloaked, and targets buildings with instant destruction, sacrificing himself in the process. 
; They have access to the Saboteur Lv. 4C ("Saboteur Elite")
; He is cloaked, and targets buildings with C4. 
; This will instantly destroy the building. 
; He has no means of attacking infantry or vehicles. 
;
; Brotherhood: 
; They have access both to the Mad Bomber 
; The weapons of all of these units are the "Explosives" line of weapons. 
; The "Saboteur" and "C4" features are not rendered by weapons. They are hardcoded. 
; However, there is a weapon ("FakeC4" in vanilla) used to render the Chrono Commando's C4 ability. 
; There is one more unit which has an innate suicidal building-damaging ability. This is the Engineer (now Machinist). 
; He can enter a building and deal %dmg to it. 
; These units combine some characteristics from the "Spy" class, in that they notoriously have stealth features. 
; They also have a direct relation with the Grenadier class, in that both deploy explosives. 
; The transmission here is by the Demoman class.

; - launches "proxy mines"
; The proxy mines will be a pain to code, because we want them to turn into IvanBombs on vehicles and buildings,

; When occupying a building, he will trap that building, causing any enemy unit that comes close to trigger explosions.
